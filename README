pokgame
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is an experimental Pokemon game implementation focused on making a
platform that allows users to build their own game versions. In this design the
game engine and version are two separate components that are networked
together. The game engine provides a so-called "default" version that it runs
locally itself.

Currently the project mostly provides a test world for the core mechanics
(e.g. walking, jumping, running into things, talking to shrubs, ETC).

The debug build plays a limited default version where you can create portal
rooms (that go nowhere).

Building

Currently builds may be done through using the makefiles or the Visual
Studio/MSBuild project file. The project builds and runs on GNU/Linux, OS X and
Windows.

The static assets are not stored in the repository and must be downloaded:

    http://www.rserver.us/downloads/pokgame-1.tar.gz

The following make commands should be used to build on GNU/Linux and OS X:

    make debug      -- build the debug version
    make test       -- build the test version

The standard 'make' command is not yet supported since the project is still
experimental.

The following dependencies must be available to the compiler:

    dstructs (linked statically)
    libpng (depends zlib)
    OpenGL

On Ubuntu/Debian the runtime dependency packages simplify to:

    libpng12-0, libgl1-mesa-glx
